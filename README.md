# RecipeApp

Currently a C++ program connected to a mysql database. This Recipe App functions as a place where users can go an generate a random recipe to make for their breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc. Users will be able to log in to their account, set their dietary restrictions, apply tags for their random recipe, and even favorite the recipes that are generated.

Future work will include transitioning the C++ program into a fully functionion front end, that utilizes a MongoDB database, and will have a working API.

Later, I will create and finalize class diagrams, user journey, ERD, market analysis, architecture pattern and design.
